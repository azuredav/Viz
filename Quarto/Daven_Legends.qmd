## Basic Box Plot

- `library(ggplot2)`: This loads the ggplot2 library.
- `ggplot(PlantGrowth, aes(x = group, y = weight))`:
    - Uses the built-in `PlantGrowth` dataset
    - Creates a plot with `group` on the x-axis and `weight` on the y-axis
    - `aes()` defines the aesthetic mappings of the plot
- `geom_boxplot()`: Adds a box plot geometry to visualize the distribution of weights across different groups
- `labs(title = 'Basic Box Plot', caption = 'By Daven, DV, THU, 2024')`: Adds a title and caption to the plot  
- `theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 20))`: Centers the title horizontally `(hjust=0.5)` and size of the text to `size = 20`

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(PlantGrowth, aes (x = group, y = weight)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = 'Basic Box Plot',
       caption = 'By Daven, DV, THU, 2024') +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 20))
```
